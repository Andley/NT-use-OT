Sensu Plenior --- 不是「隱藏 (sensus occultus)」，而是「孕藏 (sensus praegnans)」

> The canonical approach decreases and may eliminate the questionable division between the human and divine authors’ intentions in a given text. This approach does not appeal to the divine author’s meaning that is deliberately concealed from the human author in the process of inspiration (a *sensus occultus*); it appeals to the meaning of the text itself that takes on deeper significance as God’s plan unfolds (a *sensus praegnans*). When God breathes out his words through human authors, he surely knows what the ultimate meaning of their words will be, but he has not created a *double entendre* or hidden a meaning in the words that we can uncover only through special revelation. The “added meaning” that the text takes on is the product of the ultimate canonical shape, although often we can clearly perceive it only if God reveals it.

## 概要

新約使用舊約的方法必須合乎舊約上下文，否則就不足以談論聖經無誤 (inerrancy)。因為如果新約作者在使用舊約的過程中，連解讀的方式都不合上下文 (有誤)，把舊約文本都給讀錯、用錯了 (wrong text)，那還有什麼資格談論正確的教義 (right doctrine)，更別提什麼聖經無誤了。

## [I] 界定問題 Correctly Defining the Problem

- 認為 historical sense 才是經文唯一合理含意的想法，其實是十七、十八世紀現代主義 (高等批判) 下的產物。
- 之前的基督徒認為，新舊約彼此協調，因此會用 figural sense 含意

## [II] 九種可能解答 Proposed Solutions to the Problem

### 1) Fideism

### 2) Subjectivism

### 3) Jewish Exegetical Methods

### 4) Dual Authorship

### 5) Walter Kaiser's Theological Exegesis

### 6) Richard B. Hays's Intertextual Approach

### 7) Typology

### 8) Sensus Plenior

### 9) Canonical Approach

## [III] 結論 A Final Note
